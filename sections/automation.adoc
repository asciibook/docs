== Automation

The best way to use Asciibook is used on CI/CD system. Any CI/CD service that supports docker can use Asciibook.

This chapter shows how to configure different CI/CD systems.

=== GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is the official CI/CD service on GitHub. It's free for open source project and charge by running time for private project.

Create file `.github/workflows/asciibook.yml` in your repo with this content:

[source, yaml]
----
name: Build and Publish

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    container:
      image: asciibook/asciibook
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: build book
        run: |
          asciibook build mybook.adoc
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: build
          path: build
----

It means when push or pull request on this repo, create a job to run `asciibook build mybook.adoc`, and upload the `build` directory to workflow artifact, then you can download the build tarball from workflow status page.

If you want to pubilsh HTML result to GitHub pages, add the following content under `jobs`:

[source, yaml]
----
  publish:
    needs: build
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: build
      - name: Publish to Github Pages
        run: |
          cd build/html
          touch .nojekyll
          git init
          git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
          git config user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m 'asciibook build'
          git push --force https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git master:gh-pages
          rm -fr .git
          cd ../..
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
----

It means when push to master branch, create a job to push HTML result to `gh-pages` branch.

GitHub pages needs to be triggered manually in first time, go to settings page of project, select source from gh-pages branch, and select a theme to trigger publish.

Then push something to master branch to trigger GitHub Actions build, your pages will be publish later.
